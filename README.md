# smart attendance system using face recognition
Face is the crucial part of the human body that uniquely identifies a person. Using the 
face characteristics as biometric, the face recognition system can be implemented. The 
most demanding task in any organization is attendance marking. In traditional attendance 
system, the students are called out by the teachers and their presence or absence is 
marked accordingly. However, these traditional techniques are time consuming and 
tedious. 
 
In this project, the Open CV based face recognition approach has been proposed. This 
model integrates a camera that captures an input image, an algorithm for detecting face 
from an input image, encoding and identifying the face, marking the attendance in a 
spreadsheet. The training database is created by training the system with the faces of the 
authorized students. The cropped images are then store as a database with respective 
labels. The features are extracted using LBPH algorithm.
